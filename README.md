## Day 1
Write a program to check the following conditions for the three numbers a, b, and c:
Check if all numbers are even, and if not, check if they are divisible by 3.
if the sum of all three numbers is divisible by 5, while ensuring no number is zero.
If any of the conditions fail, the program should return a message indicating which condition failed.

## Day 3
Create a set of extension methods for the string type that perform common string manipulations. The task is to create the following methods as extension methods:
ToTitleCase(): Converts a string to title case (capitalizes the first letter of each word).
ReverseString(): Reverses the characters of the string.
IsPalindrome(): Checks if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
WordCount(): Counts the number of words in the string (words are separated by spaces).
